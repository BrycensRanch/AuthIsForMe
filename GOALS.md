# Project outline

This project was meant to sunset the other proprietary Minecraft Authentication systems while also doing NameMC's job. This would include a comprehensive REST API as well for developers and users and mimic NameMC's conveniency.

The goal of this project is not to be some kind of cash cow or anything like that, but rather for it to be sustainable to run & maintain. At the moment, I can't imagine sustaining the site off of purely donations compared to motivating users to keep the site up with benefits. Possibly with some kind of tier system or a subscription or one-time payment system the site could have a much brighter future while still being "free software" . Not necessarily free as in beer. (I'm not old enough to drink beer)

## Project Goals

- Compete with Scarsz Minecraft Authentication
- Compete with mc-auth
- Integration with every plugin market place that has a JSON REST API so it can have features that NameMC has long neglected like tighter integration with Microsoft or marking certain Minecraft profiles as developers based off of the plugins they maintain, across different Minecraft marketplaces.
- Animation somehow with a user waving for premium users (Honestly, this might be justifiable considering the computing needing for this)
- Document all the current weirdness in the project and explain our decisions for the project.
- Update the CONTRIBUTING.md to reflect the current state of the project.
- Remove all the numerous files in root folders of our workspaces and directories to make it less cluttered.
- Capes from multiple places
- List all your alt accounts
- Integrate with top servers APIs to display 'badges' ie `Skywars Master II`

### Ecosystem?

- Developers should be able to use the REST JSON API to interact with the project, such as user actions and permissions.

## ETA

This project is expected to be finished approximately when Hytale releases. ðŸ’€
